Get geolocation information based on domain or IP address.

**Limitations**

Since this module required to compile geoip c library during the installtion, due to the difficulty of compilifa this c library on windows, currenlty, __this module can not be used on windows, yet.__

I recommend that choosing  a pure javascript implementation instead, [`node-geoip`](https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip) maybe your best candicate.

###Technical Architecture

![new_architecture](https://github.com/kuno/GeoIP/raw/master/misc/new_architecture.png)

###Memory leak issue
As up to the version 0.4.7 (commit [22dadd98646f75318412b54b3de90cc079d34b1d](https://github.com/kuno/GeoIP/commit/22dadd98646f75318412b54b3de90cc079d34b1d)), there will be some memory leak when new a object from GeoIP class.

Here is the [report](https://gist.github.com/4357339), I'll update it frequently.

Fortunately, the number of leaked bytes is not huge, and you wont new a object very offen.

If you are willing to fix this but, please fork this project.

###Need support special database?
Currently, this package supports the most common databases from MaxMind.

But, it still a lot of special databases out there.

Since I am not a user of any product/service of maxmind, if you require this pacakge to support special db, please make sure you can delivery the testing db and the ip address/domain that can be used to against the db.

[sudo] npm install geoip [-g]
